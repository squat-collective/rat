# Installation

Get RAT up and running on your machine in under 5 minutes. No git clone needed — just Docker.

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing RAT, make sure you have the following installed:

| Requirement | Minimum Version | Check Command |
|---|---|---|
| **Docker** | 24.0+ | `docker --version` |
| **Docker Compose** | 2.20+ (V2 plugin) | `docker compose version` |
| **RAM** | 4 GB free | — |
| **Disk** | 2 GB free | — |

<Callout type="warning">
RAT runs 7 containers simultaneously. If your machine has less than 4 GB of free RAM,
you may experience slow startups or container crashes — especially the runner and ratq
services which load DuckDB and PyArrow into memory.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
Docker Compose V2 is required (the `docker compose` plugin, not the legacy `docker-compose` standalone binary).
Most modern Docker Desktop installations include V2 by default.
</Callout>

---

## Quick Install

Run a single command to download everything and start RAT:

```bash filename="Terminal"
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squat-collective/rat/main/install/install.sh | bash -s -- --start
```

This creates a `rat/` directory with `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`, then starts all services. Once complete, open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

---

## Manual Install

If you prefer to do things step by step:

<Steps>

### Create a directory and download files

```bash filename="Terminal"
mkdir rat && cd rat
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squat-collective/rat/main/install/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squat-collective/rat/main/install/.env -o .env
```

### Start all services

```bash filename="Terminal"
docker compose up -d
```

The `-d` flag runs containers in detached mode so you get your terminal back.

<Callout type="info">
The first start takes 2-5 minutes because Docker needs to pull all images.
Subsequent starts are much faster thanks to layer caching.
</Callout>

### Wait for health checks

All services register health checks with Docker. Wait until every container reports `healthy`:

```bash filename="Terminal"
docker compose ps
```

You should see output similar to:

```
NAME          STATUS                  PORTS
postgres      Up 30s (healthy)        5432/tcp
minio         Up 30s (healthy)        9000/tcp, 9001/tcp
nessie        Up 30s (healthy)        19120/tcp
ratd          Up 25s (healthy)        0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
runner        Up 20s (healthy)
ratq          Up 20s (healthy)
portal        Up 15s (healthy)        0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
```

<Callout type="info">
The `minio-init` container will show status **Exited (0)** — this is normal.
It runs once to create the S3 bucket and enable versioning, then exits.
</Callout>

You can also verify individual services manually:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Check the API server
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq .

# Check the portal
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000
```

### Open the Portal

Once all services are healthy, open your browser and navigate to:

**[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

You should see the RAT Portal dashboard. No login is required for the Community Edition — it is a single-user platform.

</Steps>

## Pinning a Version

By default, the install uses the `latest` tag. To pin a specific release:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# During install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squat-collective/rat/main/install/install.sh | bash -s -- --version=2.1.0

# Or manually — replace :latest with the version tag in docker-compose.yml
# image: ghcr.io/squat-collective/ratd:2.1.0
```

<Callout type="info">
Pinning a version is recommended for production to avoid unexpected changes.
Check the [releases page](https://github.com/squat-collective/rat/releases) for available versions.
</Callout>

---

## Service Ports

These are the ports exposed on your host machine:

| Service | Port | URL | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Portal** | 3000 | [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) | Web IDE — your main interface |
| **API (ratd)** | 8080 | [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) | REST API server |
| **MinIO Console** | 9001 | [localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) | S3 storage admin UI |
| **Nessie** | 19120 | [localhost:19120](http://localhost:19120) | Iceberg catalog API |

<Callout type="info">
The runner and ratq services do not expose ports to the host — they communicate with
ratd over the internal Docker network via gRPC.
</Callout>

---

## Default Credentials

| Service | Username | Password | Configured In |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MinIO Console** | `minioadmin` | `minioadmin` | `.env` → `S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `S3_SECRET_KEY` |
| **PostgreSQL** | `rat` | `rat` | `.env` → `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` |

The MinIO console at [localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) lets you browse the raw data
files stored in S3. You do not need to access it during normal use — it is helpful for
debugging and verifying that pipeline data has been written correctly.

<Callout type="warning">
These are development credentials. If you deploy RAT in production, change them in your
`.env` file. See the [Deployment](/deployment) section for guidance.
</Callout>

---

## Stopping RAT

To stop all services while preserving your data:

```bash filename="Terminal"
docker compose down
```

To stop all services **and delete all data** (volumes):

```bash filename="Terminal"
docker compose down -v
```

<Callout type="error">
The `-v` flag removes all Docker volumes, which means all your pipelines, runs, tables,
and stored data will be permanently deleted. Use this only when you want a clean slate.
</Callout>

---

## Upgrading

Pull the latest images and restart:

```bash filename="Terminal"
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

If you pinned a version, update the tags in `docker-compose.yml` first (or re-run the installer with `--version=X.Y.Z`).

See the full [Upgrading guide](/deployment/upgrading) for backup procedures, rollback, and migration details.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port conflicts

If a port is already in use, Docker will fail to bind it. Check for conflicts:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Check which process is using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Or on Linux without lsof
ss -tlnp | grep 3000
```

Common conflicts:
- **Port 3000** — Another Node.js or React development server
- **Port 8080** — Java application servers, other API servers
- **Port 9001** — Other MinIO instances
- **Port 5432** — A local PostgreSQL installation

To resolve, either stop the conflicting process or override the port in your compose
environment.

### Container crashes or OOM

If containers keep restarting, you likely do not have enough memory:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Check container resource usage
docker stats --no-stream
```

Solutions:
- Close other memory-intensive applications (browsers, IDEs)
- Increase Docker Desktop memory limit (Settings -> Resources -> Memory -> set to 4 GB+)
- On Linux with cgroup limits, ensure the Docker daemon has at least 4 GB available

### Checking logs

View logs for all services:

```bash filename="Terminal"
docker compose logs -f
```

View logs for a specific service:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# API server logs
docker compose logs -f ratd

# Runner logs (pipeline execution)
docker compose logs -f runner

# Portal logs
docker compose logs -f portal
```

### Services fail to connect to each other

If ratd reports that it cannot reach runner, ratq, or Nessie, the services may have
started out of order. Restart them:

```bash filename="Terminal"
docker compose restart ratd runner ratq
```

### Clean start

If something is fundamentally broken, you can start completely fresh:

```bash filename="Terminal"
docker compose down -v
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
