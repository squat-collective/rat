/**
 * Centralized SWR cache key factory.
 *
 * Every SWR key in the portal is constructed through this object so that
 * cache invalidation stays consistent and typo-proof. Keys are plain strings
 * (SWR's default key type) built from deterministic path-like patterns.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   useSWR(KEYS.pipeline("ns", "silver", "orders"), fetcher)
 *   mutate(KEYS.pipeline("ns", "silver", "orders"))
 *   mutate(KEYS.match.pipelines)  // broad invalidation via matcher fn
